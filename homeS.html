      What is an INC grade? An INC grade is a grade given to a student which
      indicates that the student has not completed all the assigned coursework
      for a class. The reason that a student may recieve an INC grade is if an
      instructor believes that the student can pass the course by completing the
      missing assignments. The problem is that students may find it difficult to
      manage and keep up with coursework. This can range from several factors
      from personal to blatant procrastination. Furthermore, students know very
      little about the BMCC grading system other than the A,B,C,D,F grades.
      Failure to understand the INC grade may lead to an unresolved INC grade.
      This lack o awareness and proactive engagement adversely affects student's
      academic progess and overall experience. The curreny INC resolution rate
      is only 50%.
